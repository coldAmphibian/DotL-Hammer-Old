When working, try to form a team with what you're interested in. eg. if you want to work on Vel'Koz's voice lines, actually talk to the guy who is working on the Vel'Koz programming, texture work, and model. This would make champion importing more coherant. Due to the nature of this project, the natures of some of the champions may change a little bit, so please work together so that the animation, sound effects and voice acting etc. all match... please...

Rito's textures removed to stop copyrighterino, you can add them yourself though... they live under [levels/map1/scene/textures](https://mega.co.nz/#!IcV2mKSR!A_Fliy58oUUZjN4f22ECdT2B1XzBPOy-9n4getANkr4). Convert anything beginning in grnd to a .psd and moving it to materials/sumrif

##The Plan
Map maker (that's me)
* Start populate the jungle with dota creeps
* Launch when map is playable
* Start work on programming and make map prettier

Programmers
* Start adding champions, Use wiki for stats and the conversion of 550 dota range = 750 lol range
* No ap system yet, once an ap system is in place, start adding ap ratios to spells and skills
* BUSHESSSSSS
* Cool Resources: [Sublime Text Packages](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/Dota-2-Sublime-Packages), [Modding Dump](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/dota-modding-dump/tree/master/dota), [Hero Programming](https://github.com/cris9696/DotaCustomFilesJoiner)

Modellers/Animators!
* Work on in game assets like the jungle islands
* Champion models, Follow the [workshop requirements](http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements) for maximum good
* Poros!

Sounds/Music
* Fitting music if you want to try, haven't really considered it
* Remixes of the lol theme which fits as being not too destracting
* Hopefully eventually we can have champion select, so music for that would be cool too

Voice Acting
* Voice acting, have a listen to all the interactions on the dota wiki to see the quality that should be aimed for
* [Rice pirate's guide to not sounding shitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r90Xy9eIU8E)
* Mandatory Voice Line List: "Here's *x* in your eye", "Good thing I have my *y* move"

Artists
* skill icons
* map textures
* in game artwork
